## Bobby Bot - Custom Discord bot by BobbyTheCatfish

Bobby Bot is built in Node.js. It runs on a [modified version](https://github.com/BobbyTheCatfish/augurbot/) of the [Augur framework](https://github.com/Gaiwecoor/augurbot), utilizing the Discord.js library. Note that for now, you'll have to manually install my version of augur in your node_modules folder instead of installing the main version.

Pull requests from the community are welcome. Some code is based on [Icarus, a bot for the LDSG server](https://github.com/LaughLax/icarus5), which I've helped develop
