## Bobby Bot - Custom Discord bot by BobbyTheCatfish

Icarus is built in Node.js. It runs on a [modified version](https://bitbucket.org/BobbyTheCatfish/augurbot/) of the [Augur framework](https://bitbucket.org/Gaiwecoor/augurbot), utilizing the Discord.js library. Note that for now, you'll have to manually install my version of augur in your node_modules folder instead of installing the main version.

Pull requests from the community are welcome. A more complete reference template for this is [Icarus, a bot for the LDSG server](https://github.com/Gaiwecoor/icarus4)
